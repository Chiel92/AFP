Third set of assignments
========================

_Chiel ten Brinke 3677133_
_Mattias Beimers 3672565_

The source code for the different assignments can be found the .hs files or .txt files with their corresponding names.
We also have an almost complete proof on 6.1 assert preservePos and assert preservePos',
but feel free to ignore it, as the counterexamples are more suitable.
