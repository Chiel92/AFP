G |- e : t
    means in environment G, term e has type t

Consider the following system of classes.

1) class A a
2) class (A a) => B a
3) instance A Bool
4) instance B Bool
5) instance A a => A (Maybe a)
6) instance (A a, B a) => A [a]

Prove:
i) B Int |- A (Maybe (Maybe Int))
ii) âˆ…  |- A (Maybe [Bool])

i)
class (A a) => (B a)
--------------------(super)
   (B a) |- (A a)       (a -> Int) (this is a substitution)
   -------------------------------(closure)
           (B Int) |- (A Int)              instance B Int
           ----------------------------------------------(inst)
                         (A Int)                               instance (A a) => A (Maybe a)
                         -------------------------------------------------------------------(inst)
                                                 A (Maybe Int)                                     instance (A a) => A (Maybe a)
                                                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(inst)
                                                                                    A (Maybe (Maybe Int))
